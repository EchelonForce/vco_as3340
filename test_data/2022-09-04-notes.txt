data was collected from a rigol dg1062 which seems to not be very robust for screen shots so there are duplicate files on disk?! 
whatever. 
most of the data is there and I used a paper record from a Trio FC756 too:

Because the CV was falling this might be a little skewed because that would counter the drift upward.
So bloody hard to test this.

While I had DUT2 warmed up, I also measured the frequency drift against the PWM, for this I just read the duty and freq off the rigol. The trio struggled at the lowest duty.

PWM Duty +/-1%   Frequency +/-0.1Hz
~ 1%             1009.5
  5%             1009.2
 10%             1008.8
 15%             1008.4
 25%             1007.9
 30%             1007.3
 35%             1006.7
 40%             1006.3
 45%             1005.9
 50%             1005.3
 55%             1004.6
 60%             1004.3
 65%             1003.7
 70%             1003.3
 75%             1002.6
 80%             1002.2
 85%             1001.5
 90%             1000.9
 95%             1000.3
~98%              999.6 - The falling edge prevents any larger duty.

So there's 10hz drift (~1%) over the range of the pwm input.
